# Introduction to Bayesian Modelling for Ecologists and Environmental Scientists

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, participants are expected to be able to:
* Describe Bayes theorem and its constituent terms: the prior, the likelihood, and the posterior
* Identify the differences in the theoretical bases of frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics
* Describe three commonly applied numerical methods in Bayesian analysis: Metropolis-Hastings sampling, Gibbs sampling, and sequential Monte Carlo
* Recognise the importance of concepts such as chain length, convergence, thinning, and adaptation in the application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical methods
* Build statistical models using three regularly used Bayesian software platforms: JAGS, STAN, INLA
* Recognise and describe advanced modelling concepts such as latent variables, hierarchical models, and random effects
* Demonstrate how to fit simulation (process-based) models using approximate Bayesian methods
