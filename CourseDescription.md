Joseph Chipperfield (NMBU), Florian Hartig (Universität Regensburg), Jörn Pagel (Universität Hohenheim)

### ECTS Credits
3

### Department
Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management

### Teaching Language
EN (NO=norsk, EN=engelsk)

### Limits of Class Size
25

### Teaching Exam Periods
The course runs for one week in early autumn.  Full attendance is mandatory during these dates.  The course assessment is due six weeks after the finishing date of the residential study period.

### Course Frequency
Annually

### First Time
2017H

### Preferential Right
This is an international summer school.  Course participants will be a mixture of students and academic staff at all levels from a number of academic institutions (not just NMBU).  The course is aimed at PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, but we will consider applications from motivated masters students who meet the recommended prerequisites.

## Course Contents
This course introduces participants to the theory and application of Bayesian models with a focus on environmental and ecological research.  Participants will be provided a hands-on introduction of exploring and analysing data using Bayesian tools through a series of computer-led workshops using data from ecological examples.  The course will cover:
* The theory behind Bayesian analysis and when and why to use it
* Methods of Bayesian computation and how to use the software to perform it
* How to expand Bayesian models to more advanced topics in statistical modelling such as latent variables, hierarchical random effects, and simulation/process-based models
* How to use Bayesian techniques to choose and rank the best models from a suite of candidate models

This course is an annual research-skills residential course and will include participants from a number of different research institutions at different stages of their research career.  Full details on the location where the course will take place, a programme of study, and how to apply can be found on the course website www.bayessummerschool.com

## Learning Outcomes

### Knowledge
By the end of the course, participants on the course will know:
* The theory behind Bayes theorem and its constituent terms: the prior, the likelihood, and the posterior
* The differences in the theoretical bases of null-hypothesis testing, likeihood-based approaches, and Bayesian modelling
* The different numerical approaches to fitting Bayesian models: rejection sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
* The importance of concepts such as chain length, convergence, thinning, and adaptation in the application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical methods
* A selection of methods for performing Bayesian model selection (DIC, Bayes factors, reversible-jump MCMC)

### Skills
By the end of the course, participants are expected to be able to:
* Build statistical models using three regularly used Bayesian software platforms: JAGS, STAN, INLA
* Apply numerical methods such as MCMC to fit Bayesian models to ecological and environmental data
* Incorporate advanced modelling concepts such as latent variables, and random effects into Bayesian models
* Perform Bayesian model selection to select between a number of competing models
* Demonstrate how to fit simulation (process-based) models using approximate Bayesian methods

### Competence
By the end of the course, participants will have competency in:
* Incorporating Bayesian analysis into their standard R workflow through the use of packages linking to external Bayesian software
* Specifying models in a number of different Bayesian modelling platforms
* Running and refining numerical methods to fit Bayesian models and avoiding common pitfalls such as lack of convergence and non-identifiability of parameters
* Interpreting the output of a Bayesian analysis and ensuring its consistency through model-checking and convergence assessment

## Learning Activities
The course will primarily take the form of an intensive 5 day residential workshop with a programme of lectures and computer exercises.  There will be some group work based on the participants own research and a series of 'after-dinner forums' which will be a series of late-night round table discussions on topics brought up during the day.

## Teaching Support
All teachers will be present during the residential study period and the course organiser will be able to field questions related to the assessment exercise during normal office hours.

## Syllabus
A full programme with links to the relevant teaching materials will be posted on the course website: http://www.bayessummerschool.com/programme.html

In addition material from the following books will be covered:
Lunn, D., Jackson, C., Best, N., Thomas, A., Spiegelhalter, D. (2012) The BUGS book: a practical introduction to Bayesian analysis.  CRC Press.
Kéry, M. (2010) Introduction to WinBUGS for ecologists.  Academic Press.
Kéry, M., Schaub, M. (2011) Bayesian population analysis using WinBUGS.  Academic Press.

## Prerequisites
Familiarity with basic statistics (STAT100 or higher for NMBU students).

## Recommended Prerequisites
It is highly recommended that participants have a working knowledge of the R statistical platform and have experience using it for ecological/environmental research (ECOL300 and ECOL340 provide NMBU participants with a good grounding in this).  Ideally, participants are actively involved in a research project: masters students should have chosen a topic for their masters thesis.

## Mandatory Activity
Participants are required to attend the entire residential study period.  The residential study period takes place in early autumn (see the course website for exact dates www.bayessummerschool.com).

## Assessment
After the residential study period is complete, participants will be required to complete a small project detailing an application of the methods learned during the residential study period.

## Nominal Workload
90 hours in total: 40 hours of residential teaching, 50 hours of self-study.

## Entrance Requirements
Special requirements in Science

## Type of Course
Residential study course (over 5 days) comprising of approximately 30 hours of lectures and 10 hours of statistical workshop exercises.

## Note
This is a residential course.  Participants will be required to stay on-site during the residential study period.  Participants will also be required to organise their own travel to and from the residential course although accommodation and board will be organised by the course organisers.  Participants will also be required to pay a fee to cover the accommodation and food whilst on-site at the residential site.  See the course website for full details: http://www.bayessummerschool.com

## Examination Details
After the course is completed, the participant will complete a small written piece of work detailing the application of Bayesian methods to an example from their work: pass/fail
