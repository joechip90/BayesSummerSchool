        	<p>We are pleased to announce our 8th international summer school on Bayesian modelling in the ecological and environmental sciences.  This year the course will take place at the <a href="http://www.muho.no/lyngheisenteret">Heathland Centre</a> on the beautiful island of Lygra in western Norway.</p>
			<h1>Motivation</h1>
			<p>Bayesian inference is an increasingly used statistical framework in ecology and the environmental sciences but it is still rarely taught within the standard curriculum.  This course provides a practical introduction to Bayesian inference covering both the theory and application of Bayesian methods using a number of examples motivated from the ecological and environmental sciences.  The course is taught with early-career researchers in mind (PhD students and post-doctoral researchers) but we welcome applications from all researchers at any stage in their career.</p>
			<h1>Contents</h1>
			<p>The contents of the course will include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction to the concepts of Bayesian statistics (priors, likelihoods, etc.)</li>
			    <li>Sampling methods (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, rejection sampling, etc.)</li>
			    <li>Bayesian modelling and hierarchical Bayesian models</li>
			    <li>The BUGS model language and its implementations such as <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> and <a href="http://www.openbugs.net/w/FrontPage">OpenBUGS</a></li>
				<li>An introduction to other Bayesian modelling software such as <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">STAN</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianTools/index.html">BayesianTools</a>, and <a href="http://www.r-inla.org/">INLA</a></li>
				<li>Demonstration of how to fit process-based/simulation models using Bayesian methods</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The course will consist of lectures, practical exercises (with R and JAGS) and talks on advanced topics in Bayesian statistics.  Course language will be English.  This is an introductory course, but a basic knowledge of general statistics as well as a competency in R or another programming language will be highly beneficial to profit from this course.</p>
            <h1>Price</h1>
            <p>The total price for the 5 day course is 6200 NOK (approximately 650€ or £570).  This price includes accommodation from the 16<sup>th</sup> September to the 21<sup>st</sup> September, 3 meals on each of the full teaching days (17<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup> September) and an evening meal on the night of the 16<sup>th</sup> September.  Tea, coffee, and light snacks will also be provided.</p>
			<h1>ECTS Credits</h1>
			<p>Upon successful completion of the course, enrolled PhD students are eligible to claim 3 ECTS credits from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU).  Participants who wish to claim ECTS credits must complete a small assessment that will involve approximately 40 hours of self-study after the residential period.  This assessment will take the form of a description of an application of Bayesian analysis methods in the participant's own research.</p>
			<h1>Apply</h1>
			<p>Applications to the course can be made <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/5O3l9jzqQA352x6X2">here</a>.  Note that because we often have many applicants for the course, we try to preferentially offer course places to those participants who would benefit most.  The application deadline to make the initial selection round is 8th July.</p>
