        	<p>We are pleased to announce our 7th international summer school on Bayesian Modelling in the ecological and environmental sciences.  This year the course will take place at the <a href="http://www.muho.no/lyngheisenteret">Heathland Centre</a> on the beautiful island of Lygra in western Norway.</p>
			<h1>Motivation</h1>
			<p>Bayesian inference is an increasingly used statistical framework in ecology and the environmental sciences but it is still rarely taught within the standard curriculum.  This course provides a practical introduction to Bayesian inference covering both the theory and application of Bayesian methods using a number of examples motivated from the ecological and environmental sciences.  The course is taught with early-career researchers in mind (PhD students and post-doctoral researchers) but we welcome applications from all researchers at any stage in their career.</p>
			<h1>Contents</h1>
			<p>The contents of the course will include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction to the concepts of Bayesian statistics (priors, likelihoods, etc.)</li>
			    <li>Sampling methods (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, rejection sampling, etc.)</li>
			    <li>Bayesian modelling and hierarchical Bayesian models</li>
			    <li>The BUGS model language and its implementations such as JAGS and OpenBUGS</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The course will consist of lectures, practical exercises (with R and JAGS) and talks on advanced topics in Bayesian statistics.  Course language will be English.  If desired, we can provide certificates with ECTS credits.  This is an introductory course, but a basic knowledge of general statistics as well as a competency in R or another programming language will be highly beneficial to profit from this course.</p>
            <h1>Price</h1>
            <p>The total price for the 5 day course is 5800 NOK (approximately 615€ or £520).  This price includes accommodation from the 24<sup>th</sup> September to the 29<sup>th</sup> September, 3 meals on each of the full teaching days (25<sup>th</sup> to 29<sup>th</sup> September) and an evening meal on the night of the 24<sup>th</sup> September.  Tea, coffee, and light snacks will also be provided.</p>
